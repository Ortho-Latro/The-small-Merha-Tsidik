HI there, Greetings to all of the peoples who see this repository
// About the system
 If you look the code in your editor, the system is an Authentication system Backend designed for a website (in this case). The programme
it uses is javascript (js) ==> nodejs with its framework which is expressjs.

# About the Readme
  This readme talks about only the authenticaton backend system of our website, and as you can see there is an uploaded documents, 
these documents are the backend auth system. 

# About the backend auth system
  The Auth system let's you signin to the website via a username, a unique email and also a password with a min lenght of 8 character, 
and also as any authnetication system, this backend auth system lets you login only by using your email and password.

# About the security of the system
  This system keeps your privacy like your password hidden by using a hash system, in this system the password is hashed using bcrypt and when 
a user try to login the system will compare the password. As you know if a password is hashed using bcrypt, it is hard to reverse it. 
So your password is safe with a salt of 10.

* And other thing is that there will be a token given by the system using jsonwebtoken when a user signin and also login.

Good Luck, Thanks
